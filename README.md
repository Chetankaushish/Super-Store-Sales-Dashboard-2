Building a Clean Dashboard and Visual Data Summary

Creating a clean dashboard in Power BI involves collecting, cleaning, and visualizing business data in a way that helps decision-makers quickly understand key trends and performance metrics. A good dashboard should:

Use clear KPIs (like Total Sales, Profit, Quantity) to give an instant overview of business performance.

Include visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to show data distribution across time, region, and category.

Maintain a consistent layout and minimal color scheme to keep the design professional and easy to interpret.

Allow interactive filtering (e.g., by region or category) so users can explore the data dynamically.

This helps business users make data-driven decisions, identify top-performing products or regions, and recognize seasonal sales trends.
